# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Multiple-ML-Models
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using multiple Machine Learning models. The aim is to analyze historical stock market data, apply different ML algorithms, and compare their performance in forecasting future prices.
ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with Multiple ML Models
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning can be used to predict stock prices based on historical data. Multiple models are implemented and compared to evaluate their accuracy and effectiveness in time-series forecasting.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of historical stock price data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of multiple ML models:

Linear Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

LSTM (optional if included)

Model evaluation using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, RÂ² score

Comparison of model performance to determine the best approach

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy â€“ Data handling

Matplotlib, Seaborn â€“ Visualization

Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras (if LSTM) â€“ Machine Learning models

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the script:

python stock_price_prediction.py

ðŸ”¹ Results

Comparison of different models in terms of prediction accuracy

Visualization of actual vs predicted stock prices

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Incorporating deep learning models like GRU/Transformers

Using real-time stock market APIs for live predictions

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
